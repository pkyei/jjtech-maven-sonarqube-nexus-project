- install tree with command: sudo yum install tree -y
- https://github.com/awanmbandi/maven-nexus-project-eagles-batch/blob/maven-nexus-install/maven-install.md

## Maven commands
1. clone the source code from repository where it is stored.
2. cd into the cloned folder
3. cd in the javawebapp folder where the source code for the app is found prior to start running maven commands.
4. Run the following `maven`/`mvn` commands to validate/package/deploy your app artifacts remotely
   - `mvn validate`   (validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.)
   - `mvn compile`    (compile the source code of the project and craetes a target directory)
   - `mvn test`       (run tests using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed.)
   - `mvn package`    (take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a WAR/JAR/EAR.)
   - `mvn verify`     (run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria.)
   - `mvn install`    (install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.)

## Install SonarQube
- Launch ec2-instance with OS: ubuntu 20.04, type:t2.medium

- create new project and provide any random name. Then click setup
- Proivde name for token and generate token, select Java and then Maven.
- Copy generated command and save ina secure location.
- Navigate back to maven server and paste the command copied in previous step in the directory with pom.xml file

## Configure Nexus Repository 

Series of tutorial code snippets for use
#Maven publish tutorial steps
Publishing artifact to Nexus snapshot and release repo using maven.

1. Create a snapshot repo using nexus, or use default coming in out of the box. DEFAULT 
2. Create a release repo using nexus, or use default coming out of the box. DEFAULT
3. Create a group repo having both release, snapshot and other third party repos. or use default coming out of the box.
4. Navigate to vsCode and in the settings.cml file,
- check to ensure your username and paswword for nexus is admin:admin on line 32 & 33.
- update nexus repository urls with the current IP of nexus server on line 63 and 74 of settings.xml
- update url for sonarqube on line 86  in the settings.xml file.
- update nexus url in pom.xml file on line 57 and 61
- commit changes and push to repo
- pull chamges from within maven server
5. copy settings.xml from within maven server into .m2 directory 
- mv settings.xml ~/.m2

6. Run the following `maven`/`mvn` command to deploy jar package to a remote repo.
   - `mvn deploy`     (done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote/SNAPSHOT repository 
                      for sharing with other developers and projects.)

11. Change the version from 1.0-Snapshot to 1.1
12. Run `mvn deploy` to deploy to Snapshot Repo or `mvn clean deploy -P release`, to deploy it to Release Repo
